QUESTION:What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.
Answer:
Loops in JavaScript

Loops are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition. They are particularly useful for automating repetitive tasks, such as iterating over arrays or performing calculations.

### Why Do We Need Loops?
1. Efficiency: Reduce redundancy by executing the same code multiple times.
2. Iteration: Access or manipulate items in data structures like arrays or objects.
3. Automation: Perform repetitive tasks, such as printing a series of numbers or fetching data multiple times.


### Types of Loops in JavaScript
1. for Loop
2. while Loop
3. do...while Loop
4. for...in Loop
5. for...of Loop


1) for Loop
Used when the number of iterations is known.

Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to execute
}

Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration number:", i);
}


2) while Loop
Executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is `true`. Useful when the number of iterations is unknown.

Syntax:
while (condition) {
  // Code to execute
}


Example:

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log("Iteration number:", i);
  i++;
}


3) do...while Loop
Similar to the `while` loop, but it ensures that the code block is executed at least once, even if the condition is `false`.

Syntax:

do {
  // Code to execute
} while (condition);


Example:

let i = 0;
do {
  console.log("Iteration number:", i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);


4) for...in Loop
Iterates over the properties of an object (or the indices of an array).

Syntax:

for (key in object) {
  // Code to execute
}


Example:

let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "Mumbai" };
for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key + ":", person[key]);
}


5) for...of Loop
Iterates over the values of iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, etc.

Syntax:
for (value of iterable) {
  // Code to execute
}


Example:

let numbers = [10, 20, 30];
for (let num of numbers) {
  console.log("Number:", num);
}
