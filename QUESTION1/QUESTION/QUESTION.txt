QUESTION:What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.
ANSWER:
Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. They allow your program to make decisions and execute specific blocks of code depending on whether a given condition evaluates to `true` or `false`.

### Types of Conditional Statements in JavaScript:
1. if` Statement
2. if...else Statement
3. if...else if...else Statement
4. switch Statement
5. Ternary (Conditional) Operator

1) if Statement
Executes a block of code only if the specified condition is `true`.

Syntax:
if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if condition is true
}

Example:
let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}

2) if...else Statement
Executes one block of code if the condition is `true`, and another block of code if it is `false`.

Syntax:
if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if condition is false
}

Example:
let age = 16;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}

3) if...else if...else` Statement
Checks multiple conditions sequentially. If one condition is `true`, its block is executed, and the rest are skipped.

Syntax:
if (condition1) {
  // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if all conditions are false
}

Example:
let marks = 85;
if (marks >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (marks >= 75) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: C");
}
```

4. switch Statement
Evaluates an expression and matches it against multiple `case` values. Executes the block of code for the matching case.

Syntax:
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if expression === value2
    break;
  default:
    // Code to be executed if no cases match
}

Example:
let day = 3;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day");
}


5) Ternary (Conditional) Operator
A compact version of an `if...else` statement.

Syntax:
condition ? expression1 : expression2;

Example:
javascript
let age = 20;
let result = age >= 18 ? "Eligible to vote" : "Not eligible to vote";
console.log(result);
